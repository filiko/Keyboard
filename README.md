# Keyboard *currently broken*

Working Colemak-dhk keyboard, may update in the future to better suit programming languages as well.

Note: Must have Microsoft Keyboard Creator to read and implement .klc files (the keyboard files)

Also- use ePKL or SharpKeys to swap caps lock for backspace (:


*****need to fix missing "z" button
